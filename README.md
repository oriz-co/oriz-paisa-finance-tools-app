# Oriz Paisa — Finance tools

> SIP, EMI, FIRE, tax — calculators that show the math, run in your browser, and never see your inputs.

**Live at**: https://finance.oriz.in · **Status**: production

## What this is

A personal-finance toolkit for India. The math is the product — every calculator shows the formula it used, the assumptions it made, and the year-by-year breakdown. Inputs never leave your device.
